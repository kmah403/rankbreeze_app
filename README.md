## Comments

The application is ready by 60%. As I haven't enough time to implement the occupancy rate calculation.
I have managed to find a Airbnb API Endpoint where I am fetching the data e.g: title, country, city.
After research I have understood that occupancy rate is the ratio of time a rental property is 
occupied to the time itâ€™s made available for rent. 
The only way to calculate it would be to use Scrapping. As I'm not sure if there is a API endpoint that 
could provide us with necessary information. 
So my indent would be to use the Watir gem and chrome driver. The main thing here would be the calendar of the 
listing with its active/disabled (occupied/unoccupied) days.
